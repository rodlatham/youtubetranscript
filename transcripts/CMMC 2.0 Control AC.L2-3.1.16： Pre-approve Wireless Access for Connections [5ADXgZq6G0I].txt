ac.l2-3-1.16 you got that right
authorized wireless access prior to
allowing such connections

found your home here at on-call
compliance Solutions where we can help

it so in cmmc control

ac.l2-3.1.16 authorized wireless access
prior to allowing such connections what
does this mean what does it mean well it
means no open wireless networks are
allowed you have to have a password
token Etc but you just can't have open
wireless networks all right we're
talking about cui here even if you have
a big giant secure building that
controls mandate that authentication is
required let's check out what the ask
what the assessors are looking for and
how to make them happy on this one
so if I'm an assessor the first thing
I'm looking for is one determine if
wireless access points are identified
are they of course they are right
there's an SSID wireless network
controller system identifies all
wireless access points including both
authorized and unauthorized that's a
good sample answer so who knows maybe
you're using a ubiquity system or a
Cisco system and that system's
identifying the wireless access points
might also be good if you've got
something to detect Rogue access points
as well now the second thing that
they're looking for is determining if
wireless access is authorized prior to
allowing such Connections in other words
did somebody or something authorize you
to actually get that wireless access now
if I was going to create a sample answer
I might say something like no wireless
access is possible without authorization
via input of a secure password or maybe
a token or something like that
