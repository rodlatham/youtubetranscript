ia.l2-3.5.4 employ replay resistant
authentication mechanisms for network
access to privileged and non-privileged
accounts

stuff on top of an already colossal
workload well I've got great news for
you you've found your home here at

jump into it

cmmccontrolia.l2-3.5.4 employ replay
resistant authentication mechanisms for
network access to privileged and
non-privileged accounts what's an
instant replay just kidding what is
replay resistant it essentially means
that if someone captured your keystrokes
via a key logger they would be able that
they would not be able to play back your
keystrokes and get into your system how
do you do that there are a lot of
different ways to do this but primarily
you're looking at the concept of
implementing a rolling key or
multi-factor authentication type of
solution here's an example if you enter
your username and password and that's it
that doesn't change so someone capturing
and replaying your keystrokes could get
in however if you have a three-part
sign-in with a username a password and
an MFA key or token which rolls over
every few seconds replaying that
combination will not work to Grant
access pretty cool if you ask me but hey
I don't actually count because I don't
make the rules all right let's look at
what hey you know what this is cool the
assessor is only looking for like one
thing determine if replay resistant
authentication mechanisms are
implemented for network account access
to privilege and non-progos accounts now
what's the answer this it's simpler than
you think MFA is implemented for all
accounts able to access cui right so
same answer as last control so you don't
really have to actually do anything
unique but what you do need to know is
that MFA really is sort of your golden
ticket to stopping replay attacks pretty
cool if you ask me
