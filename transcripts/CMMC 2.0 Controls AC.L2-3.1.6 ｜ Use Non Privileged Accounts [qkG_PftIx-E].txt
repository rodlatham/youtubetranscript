hey everybody it's Mike frieder here
with on-call compliance Solutions and
I'm back I bet you never thought I'd be
back right and I'm here with a
compliance tip of the week because
that's all I really bring you even when
we shoot these daily or hourly or
monthly anyway either way it's
compliance tip of the week guess what
we're talking about this week I bet you
wouldn't guess from the description this
video it's cmmc control ac.l2-3.1.6

I know it's pretty easy to guess it was
it's right there in that description
there anyway use non-privileged accounts
or roles when accessing non-security
functions

so hey if you're a defense contractor
who's feeling overwhelmed tired and
alone
I'm sorry for you trying to understand
all this tmmc dfars and this SP 10171
compliance stuff on top of an already
colossal workload well I've got great
news for you you've found your home here
at on-call compliance Solutions where we
can help you transform into your
company's on-call compliance Hero Let's
jump into it here's a riddle if a bad
guy has a key to your house and you're
not around how would you know he was in
there lurking around

well the goal with cmmc control
ac.l2-3.1.6 use non-privileged accounts
or roles when accessing non-security
functions is to make sure that in the
event that a system is compromised all
right it would be easier to identify a
bad actor if security privileged
accounts are only used for specific
tasks revealing the potential Intruder
when those rarely used accounts are all
of a sudden used in an unusual or
unauthorized way now this is actually
really smart I got to tell you I've been
doing cyber security for 20 plus years
and this is one of those controls when I
really understood what was behind it I
thought to myself that's pretty crazy
later this will make more sense right as
we get deeper in the controls we start
talking about security information event
management systems they'll they will
actually detect anomalous activities so
in other words activity that is unusual
it's way easier to detect unusual
activity if there's a specific account
you should be watching for like those
that are privileged accounts
so as an example if an I.T person does
their day-to-day work in a standard user
account and only uses a security
privilege to have an account for admin
tasks it'll be much easier to spot
malicious actions in system logs and
alert from administrative users who are
not normally conducting those activities
it's a great way to expose information
to less risk and spot problems much
faster in addition the control also
demands you identify security privileged
accounts and events presumably so they
can be more easily identifiable when not
authorized now there are two points that
I would look for if I was assessing this
okay Point number one I would say hey
determine if non-security functions are
identified
well are they non-security functions are
identified via Group Policy there's your
hint and individual system access
restrictions right because again we can
determine if non-security functions are
identified if you're not allowed to do
them right like if you are not an
administrator in QuickBooks and you're
only a standard user and you can only
access certain records well then that's
defined as those records you can't find
right maybe not the best example but you
kind of get the point
now the second point of assessment is
determine if users are required to use
non-privileged accounts or roles when
accessing non-security functions hey
it's probably a test they're probably
going to want a demonstration hey if
you're a standard user can you go
install software no you get an access
denied hopefully uh if we were to write
down an answer maybe we would write down
something like all privileged account
holders also have non-published accounts
for non-privileged functions and
activities which they are required to
use when not performing privileged
functions determination and audit of
this use is performed via the same
system if you don't know what a seam
system is I got about 100 videos that
you haven't watched yet all right but
it's called a security information event
management system and essentially it's
the system that watches over your house
when you're not at home okay now if
you're still scratching your head and
you're like I don't get it this is
intense no way am I gonna be able to
come up with another 109 controls with
the answers or you have no idea how to
write the policies you need help with
