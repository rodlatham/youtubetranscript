with on-call compliance Solutions and
I'm back with another compliance tip of
the week this week we're talking about
cmmc control ia.l
2-3.5.8 prohibit password reuse for a
specified number of generations

say hey if you're a defense contractor

stuff on top of an already colossal
workload well I've got green news for
you you've found your home here at
on-call compliance Solutions where we

jump into it cmmc control
ia.l2-3.5.8 prohibit password reuse for
a specified number of generations no
we're not talking about your parents
we're talking about Generations okay so
on this one it's another great best
practice reminder that's really all this
is it's one thing to require users to
change their passwords but we also must
remember that users are creatures of
habit they will literally flip back and
forth between the same two passwords if
you let them ask me how I know so this
control mandates that we look at the
settings for how many generations of
passwords in other words how many times
can you use the same passwords in a row
to remember and make sure it's specified
and I recommend a little bit more than
just two or three passwords what this
prevents is a compromised password from
coming back into rotation and allowing
for attack so let's take into what the
assessors are really going to look for
and what they have to say on this one
all right two points of assessment here
determine if the number of generations
during which a password cannot be reused
is specified uh again we would say most
likely that this is implemented via
group policy or system policy of some
kind and then we might throw out a
number let's just say like 10 right uh
again you can't repeat the password for
at least 10 different Generations next
assessment Point determine if reusive
password is prohibited during the
specified number of generations
again here we would say this is
implemented via the group policy so
again Group Policy probably the easiest
way to do it you may have some other
configuration or setting depending upon
what system you're in but in this
example we'll just give the easy one
which is to say hey look at group policy
